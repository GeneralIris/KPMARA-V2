# KPMARA-V2
This project was made during my internship ;)

# What is dis?
A system that shows the locations of available clinics for MARA employees as they are provided medical benifits using MS-SQL.

# Who can use them?
Specifically MARA employees

# Does it have any GPS capabilities?
Unfortunatelly no ;(

# How well it's being codded?
I can say this was my first experience with ajax and MS-SQL. It was fun and other employees there also help me ;)

# Is the actual DB correlates to the actual MARA DB structure?
No, I structure them my self, no DB reference given to me, only requirements

# Credits
A trillion thanks to my supervisor, sys admin and other employees there that guide me on understand how the real working environment is
